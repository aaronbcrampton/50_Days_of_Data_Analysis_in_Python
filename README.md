# 50_Days_of_Data_Analysis_in_Python
This is a tutorial to re-enforce my Data Analysis in Python. It's also a good personal reference for snippets. 
The content is from the book 50 Days of Analysis with Python the Ultimate Challenge Book for Beginners by Benjamin Alexander (Available on Amazon). 
Although at this point I'm hardly a beginner, there is always something to gleen in re-enforcing the basics.

Specifically, the focus is utilizing numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
